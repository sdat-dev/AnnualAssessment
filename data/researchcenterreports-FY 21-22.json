Over the past five years, ASRC’s payroll expenditures totaled $10,706,372 – an average of $2,141,274 per year. One full-time research facilitator and one part-time IT support person are supported by the VPR. Post-docs, research scientists, visiting scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students are primarily paid from research grants; some are supported from start-up funds provided to SUNY2020 faculty. Most ASRC faculty are on 9-month academic year appointments and are paid summer salary from research grants or start-up funds. OTPS: ASRC’s operations, including operations at the UAlbany location and at Whiteface Mountain, are covered by IFR revenue recovered from sponsored programs. Over the past five years, ASRC’s OTPS expenditures at the Albany location have totaled $202,696, an average of $40,539 per year. Not counting annual telephone charges of almost $19,000 per year, OTPS expenses at ASRC average about $21,539 per year. The Whiteface location’s OTPS expenditures over five years total $77,606, an average of $15,521 per year. One faculty member had a legacy IFR account that covered some OTPS expenses such as Verizon Wireless. Strategic Investment: In the past, ASRC has received overhead recovery from the VPR to be used to grow research activity at ASRC. We have about $70,900 remaining in cash to spend on the state-side. On the RF side there is a legacy overhead recovery account primarily used in support of our RF p-card program as the initial source to pay the Bank of America bill monthly; expenses are then moved to the appropriate sponsored award through a reconciliation process. Events: ASRC has both UAlbany Foundation funds in the Ray Falconer Endowment and UAS (Auxiliary Services) funds to support lectures and colloquies.","stateHeadcount":"22","rfHeadcount":"68","stateNumber":"20.68","rfNumber":"51.65","proposals1":"24.2","proposals2":"1","proposals3":"5","awards1":"10","awards2":"4","awards3":"2","largeScale1":"2","largeScale2":"1","sttrAwards1":"0","sttrAwards2":"0","publication1":"0","publication2":"0","publication3":"73","technologyTransfer1":"1","technologyTransfer2":"1","technologyTransfer3":"0","technologyTransfer4":"0","technologyTransfer5":"0","technologyTransfer6":"0","technologyTransfer7":"0","conference":"39","educationAndTraining1":"9","educationAndTraining2":"1","educationAndTraining3":"19","educationAndTraining4":"6","goal1":"Maintain strengths and establish new research strengths (in wake of upcoming retirements):\n•\tRenewable Energy/Grid Resiliency\n•\tAtmospheric Chemistry (including Whiteface activity)\n•\tClimate\n•\tUrban Environment and Health\n•\tAI applications in Atmospheric Sciences\n•\tHydrology (including water resources, flooding applications\n","goal2":"Establish interdisciplinary research partnerships with College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, School of Public Health and others as appropriate.
