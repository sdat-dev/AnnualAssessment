sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG will realize $429,245 in IFR revenue from seven RF projects and $265,182 from four state-side MOUs and contracts. Due to an overpayment on our Water Quality project by the sponsor, $115,255 of these funds were returned to the DEC. In addition, $68,294 in At-Risk Funding was returned by the budget office to our IFR account. Finally, total state overhead paid on these awards was $64,927. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG FY 2021-2022 was $582,539. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $435,025. The expense categories included phones, technical equipment and software, postage, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. This figure also includes fringe for all non-student categories. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. CTG’s PSR state allocation of $680,857supported 6.34 FTEs. This was reduced by $176,318 from last year’s state allocation of $857,175 and 8 FTEs in order to help support the state-side budget deficit. Due to these reductions in state supported PSR, this year CTG needed to use IFR funds to support 2 research-related positions in order to continue the work needed on various research awards, including a researcher in digital government and a program associate. CTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $923,419 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures (Phase II) award for $349,945 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation (Part 2) award for $39,000. Total new state awards equaled $388,945. New awards through the Research Foundation included a 3-year Message Design Dashboard: Development of a Standardized Messaging Tool through FEMA at $327,012 for year 1. Also, the City of Schenectady awarded the project, Enabling the State-Wide Rollout of the Share Regional Information Resource in the amount of $189,462. The NYS Association of Counties awarded CTG $16,000 to develop a Cyber Primer for local IT leaders. In addition, we received a gift in kind from NVIDIA to provide equipment and training for the TAF project already underway and is valued at approximately $2,000. Total New RF awards equaled $923,419. In addition, CTG has two proposals pending including the NSF Large-scale CoPe: Bridging Data to Action - Using Data and AI to Develop Equitable Outcomes While Augmenting Resilience to Climate Hazards in Coastal Communities for $864,923. Also submitted was a proposal to NSF for the Civic Innovation Challenge 2022 Planning Grant in coordination with the City of Schenectady for $50,000. Total potential new revenue awarded in the coming fiscal year totals $914,923. Residual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.","stateHeadcount":"11","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"10.25","rfNumber":"","additionalAmount1":"$429,245","additionalSource1":"910029-00 ","additionalAmount2":"$265,182 (before refund of overpayment from DEC & return of at-risk holding as noted above.)","additionalSource2":"900309-00","additionalAmount3":"$1,011","additionalSource3":"20-50013-00 ","federalApplicationsGoal":"2","privateApplicationsGoal":"1","stateApplicationsGoal":"2","federalApplicationsActual":"1","privateApplicationsActual":"0","stateApplicationsActual":"0","federalAwardsGoal":"1","privateAwardsGoal":"0","stateAwardsGoal":"1","federalAwardsActual":"0.3","privateAwardsActual":"0","stateAwardsActual":"0","lsProposalsGoal":"1","lsProposalsActual":"0","lsAwardsGoal":"0","lsAwardsActual":"0","sttrProposalsGoal":"0","sttrProposalsActual":"0","sttrAwardssGoal":"0","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"1","booksAuthoredActual":"","bookChaptersGoal":"0","bookChaptersActual":"","publicationsGoal":"10","publicationsActual":"","listOfPublications":"<div class=\"ExternalClass86E8E1099CFB417298559166575D2CEC\">​\r\n\r\n​1.

This year, CTG will realize $429,245 in IFR revenue from seven RF projects and $265,182 from four state-side MOUs and contracts. Due to an overpayment on our Water Quality project by the sponsor, $115,255 of these funds were returned to the DEC. In addition, $68,294 in At-Risk Funding was returned by the budget office to our IFR account. Finally, total state overhead paid on these awards was $64,927. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG FY 2021-2022 was $582,539. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $435,025. The expense categories included phones, technical equipment and software, postage, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. This figure also includes fringe for all non-student categories. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. CTG’s PSR state allocation of $680,857supported 6.34 FTEs. This was reduced by $176,318 from last year’s state allocation of $857,175 and 8 FTEs in order to help support the state-side budget deficit. Due to these reductions in state supported PSR, this year CTG needed to use IFR funds to support 2 research-related positions in order to continue the work needed on various research awards, including a researcher in digital government and a program associate. CTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $923,419 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures (Phase II) award for $349,945 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation (Part 2) award for $39,000. Total new state awards equaled $388,945. New awards through the Research Foundation included a 3-year Message Design Dashboard Development of a Standardized Messaging Tool through FEMA at $327,012 for year 1. Also, the City of Schenectady awarded the project, Enabling the State-Wide Rollout of the Share Regional Information Resource in the amount of $189,462. The NYS Association of Counties awarded CTG $16,000 to develop a Cyber Primer for local IT leaders. In addition, we received a gift in kind from NVIDIA to provide equipment and training for the TAF project already underway and is valued at approximately $2,000. Total New RF awards equaled $923,419. In addition, CTG has two proposals pending including the NSF Large-scale CoPe Bridging Data to Action - Using Data and AI to Develop Equitable Outcomes While Augmenting Resilience to Climate Hazards in Coastal Communities for $864,923. Also submitted was a proposal to NSF for the Civic Innovation Challenge 2022 Planning Grant in coordination with the City of Schenectady for $50,000. Total potential new revenue awarded in the coming fiscal year totals $914,923. Residual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.</div>","stateHeadcount":"11","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"10.25","rfNumber":"","proposals1":"1","proposals2":"1","proposals3":"1","awards1":"1","awards2":"1","awards3":"1","largeScale1":"1","largeScale2":"1","sttrAwards1":"","sttrAwards2":"","publication1":"","publication2":"","publication3":"","technologyTransfer1":"","technologyTransfer2":"","technologyTransfer3":"","technologyTransfer4":"","technologyTransfer5":"","technologyTransfer6":"","technologyTransfer7":"","conference":"","educationAndTraining1":"","educationAndTraining2":"","educationAndTraining3":"","educationAndTraining4":"","goal1":"<div class=\"ExternalClassC71816BF6E0140519C978F469DC1F57B\">​​Engage in innovative research and problem solving projects that address societal challenges</div>","goal2":"<div class=\"ExternalClass9234B4AD281742A1A21C2FFC0FF4EF58\">1</div>","goal3":"<div class=\"ExternalClass83DE435805DA4F34B5E39127B9BEF3E3\">1</div>","goal4":"","goal5":"","actions1":"<div class=\"ExternalClass9C68E48852E94C6FAD5B9AE4AB737AD0\">​​Strategically plan for and submit 5 research and other project proposals and contracts.</div>","actions2":"","actions3":"","actions4":"","actions5":"","metrics1":"Five applications processed.","metrics2":"","metrics3":"","metrics4":"","metrics5":"","timeframe1":"CTG Management Team","timeframe2":"","timeframe3":"","timeframe4":"","timeframe5":"","primaryLeader1":"CTG Management Team","primaryLeader2":"","primaryLeader3":"","primaryLeader4":"","primaryLeader5":"","impactWorkplan1":"","impactWorkplan2":"","impactWorkplan3":"","impactWorkplan4":"","impactWorkplan5":"","collaboratingUnits1":"","collaboratingUnits2":"","collaboratingUnits3":"","collaboratingUnits4":"","collaboratingUnits5":"","impactResearchExcellence1":"","impactResearchExcellence2":"","impactResearchExcellence3":"","impactResearchExcellence4":"","impactResearchExcellence5":""}},{"Unit":"Center for Social & Demographic Analysis","FY 22-23":{"unit":"Center for Social & Demographic Analysis","year":"FY 22-23","lastName":"Friedman","firstName":"Samantha","email":"samfriedman@albany.edu","mission":"CSDA's mission is to facilitate and organize population research and education of the highest caliber.

WIC is a program for nutrition of low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, infants, and children under the age of five by providing nutritious foods, information on healthy eating, breastfeeding promotion and support, and referrals to health care. Nationally and statewide, WIC services are underutilized, with only about half of those eligible using the program. This intensive assessment included extensive analyses of secondary data from the American Community Survey and from DOH itself to identify areas and demographics of relatively higher rates of WIC eligibility and lower WIC utilization, for use in future targeting and marketing efforts, as well as primary data collection and analysis (surveys of WIC participants and eligible non-participants, focus groups with WIC participants and eligible non-participants, and a survey of WIC local agency staff) to evaluate their understanding of WIC services and eligibility, successes in using WIC, barriers and challenges to using and maintaining WIC, and recommendations for future program implementation. </div>","topAchievements2":"<div class=\"ExternalClass71AD8B275333464085D9550FDAD69738\">CHSR created a Role Definition Matrix to better define performance expectations for each of the three main research positions within the Center. This matrix has helped clarify the level and amount of work expected at each role (e.g., more directed to more independent and higher-level), and guided supervisory conversations about performance issues, professional development, and promotion. Most recently, the matrix was used to support annual performance evaluations by allowing staff and supervisors to categorize the work performed and identify areas of especially strong or weak performance.</div>","topAchievements3":"<div class=\"ExternalClassAFC7CC89AEE4473DA8BD7C5944C84537\">In partnership with the Empire Justice Center and Pro Bono NY, CHSR was awarded a NYS Office of Victim Services Victims of Crime Assistance Act (VOCA) grant. This award will support CHSR’s work on the Crime Victims Legal Network website (https&#58;//crimevictimshelpny.org/), which helps victims of crime connect with legal help, including knowing their rights, finding legal services, obtaining victim compensation. In this current grant, CHSR will focus on expanding content on teen dating violence, bullying, and elder victims of crime. </div>","topAchievements4":"<div class=\"ExternalClass58AD728368694A7E9F20193D3CB87D8D\">CHSR completed a new Tableau dashboard, visualizing the history of performance reporting for Healthy Families New York, a voluntary home visiting program aimed at reducing child maltreatment by building positive parent-child relationships. As part of our ongoing evaluation, CHSR undertakes a series of fidelity and outcome reporting twice each year, reporting on program’s adherence to model specifications and implementation of expected activities in the past six months. These data are used to identify system-wide challenges, programs needing additional support, and programs who are not implementing the program as expected or needed. The dashboard shows performance history on each of 15 items, over 15 reporting cycles (about 7 years), for each of 45 programs. Performance is shown relative to the target performance and to the HFNY state average performance. The dashboards have been helpful to program and OCFS staff in determining whether low performance at a program or on an item is isolated to a particular cycle, is part of a history of low performance, or actually represents an improvement from previous cycles though still with room to grow. </div>","topAchievements5":"<div class=\"ExternalClass8803DCB5408F429AAD6B2B0F33F36B8B\">CHSR has published two research briefs in the past year. These briefs are meant to help communicate CHSR’s work and program importance to a broader audience. The Genesee-Orleans-Wyoming Opioid Task Force Report summarizes the impact of efforts to increase the number of individuals trained to administer Naloxone in the tri-county area, demonstrating huge increases in trainees as well as improvements in knowledge and self-efficacy due to training. The Crime Victims Legal Network brief explains how researchers and practitioners worked together to develop the Victim Compensation Tool, a part of the CVLN website. CHSR has also joined UAlbany’s Scholars Archive and have posted these briefs to our page there.</div>","goal1":"<div class=\"ExternalClass099180A40588436C9BB1363950EDC27E\">​​Implement Center-wide Quality Assurance planner for qualitative data collection</div>","goal2":"<div class=\"ExternalClassF0C614A257BB48F98CB7632CBB0718B8\">​​Increase use of Tableau for data dashboard displays.</div>","goal3":"<div class=\"ExternalClass8A674A3F3AA748BABA1C06B44D08D744\">​​Increase DMAC’s outreach and services to UAlbany research community.</div>","goal4":"<div class=\"ExternalClassA8363B71AB024377A6B80AE36107F8AA\">​​Increase funding by submitting applications for federal grants</div>","goal5":"Increase national visibility of CHSR’s research and results","actions1":"<div class=\"ExternalClass02C6826DB83C4EDD9D6F0F10E0A095B0\">​​Develop Quality Assurance Planner to assist Project Leads in selecting appropriate suite of QA activities to support goals of project.

CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany. CEMHD's focus on minorities and under-served populations in the smaller cities and towns of Upstate New York is premised upon the notion that health disparities found in these areas differ from those in the larger cities, and that the appropriate solutions will also differ. Since most of the research on minority health disparities, and the programs that have resulted from it, has focused on populations in large cities, relatively little is known about the distinct causes of poorer health among minorities in smaller cities. Therefore, another reason for our geographical emphasis is to fill in a gap in the research and to initiate and test the appropriate solutions.</div>","annualBudget":"Projected CEMHD ANNUAL Expenditures\nProjected expenditures from NIH funded S-21                                                         \nStipend and fringe for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $143,982.90 \nTuition and fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $91,966.09\nTravel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $12,000.00 \nTravel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Primary mentors  $12,000.00\nTravel for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Rotational mentors  $3,000.00 \nWriting support for Health Disparities Fellows  $7,890.00\nStatistical support for Health Disparities Fellows (grad student)  $6,698.64 \nSupport for advancing MHD research (grad student)  $11,164.40\nSupport for collaboration/recruitment platform development (grad student)  $24,091.60 \nLogistical support & Task Force liaison (grad student)  $25,854.40\nAssociate Director of Operations and Research   $129,535.81 \nSupport for Community Task Force   $25,000.00\nAlbany Task Force Convener   $5,000.00 \nAmsterdam Task Force Convener  $8,017.50\nDirector's stipend   $39,450.00 \nDirector Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Course releases  $20,000.00 \nEndowed Chair/Empire Innovation Professor  $25,000.00 \nPresidential Forum on Health Disparities  $12,000.00\nVenue rental with audio/visual  $2,500.00 \nCEMHD newsletter translation services  $1,200.00 \nPrinting costs for newsletter  $2,500.00\nOffice supplies  $2,000.00 \nMail/Postage  $500.00\nComputers/printers  $5,000.00 \nRapid copy  $1,000.00 \nCatering  $3,500.00\nNIH funded S-21 Total  $620,851.34\n\nProjected expenditures from Hearst Foundation\nTuition & fees (NYS rate) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows  $75,543.75\nStipend (no fringe) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows   $106,182.00 \nTravel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows   $10,000.00\nTravel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Primary mentors  $10,000.00 \nTravel for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Rotational mentors  $2,500.00\nOverhead fee (7.5%) to transfer stipend money from UAF to IFR  $7,963.65\nHearst Foundation Total  $212,189.40","stateHeadcount":"3","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"1.8","rfNumber":"","additionalAmount1":"","additionalSource1":"","additionalAmount2":"","additionalSource2":"","additionalAmount3":"","additionalSource3":"","federalApplicationsGoal":"1","privateApplicationsGoal":"1","stateApplicationsGoal":"0","federalApplicationsActual":"0","privateApplicationsActual":"0","stateApplicationsActual":"0","federalAwardsGoal":"1","privateAwardsGoal":"1","stateAwardsGoal":"0","federalAwardsActual":"0","privateAwardsActual":"1","stateAwardsActual":"0","lsProposalsGoal":"1","lsProposalsActual":"1","lsAwardsGoal":"1","lsAwardsActual":"0","sttrProposalsGoal":"0","sttrProposalsActual":"0","sttrAwardssGoal":"0","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"0","booksAuthoredActual":"","bookChaptersGoal":"0","bookChaptersActual":"","publicationsGoal":"40","publicationsActual":"","listOfPublications":"<div class=\"ExternalClass4642D5D216154AC8820C69AA14B06A5D\">​\r\n\r\n​In Press Peer Reviewed Publications (Health Disparity Training Fellows (HDTFS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Therefore, another reason for our geographical emphasis is to fill in a gap in the research and to initiate and test the appropriate solutions.</span></span><br></div></div>","annualBudget":"<div class=\"ExternalClassB555B4CE380D490B88077C10483DFA4E\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​</span>Projected CEMHD ANNUAL Expenditures<br></div><div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Projected expenditures from NIH funded S-21&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Stipend and fringe for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#160; $143,982.90<br>Tuition and fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#160; $91,966.09<br>Travel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#160; $12,000.00<br>Travel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Primary mentors&#160; $12,000.00<br>Travel for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Rotational mentors&#160; $3,000.00<br>Writing support for Health Disparities Fellows&#160; $7,890.00<br>Statistical support for Health Disparities Fellows (grad student)&#160; $6,698.64<br>Support for advancing MHD research (grad student)&#160; $11,164.40<br>Support for collaboration/recruitment platform development (grad student)&#160; $24,091.60<br>Logistical support &amp; Task Force liaison (grad student)&#160; $25,854.40<br>Associate Director of Operations and Research&#160;&#160; $129,535.81<br>Support for Community Task Force&#160;&#160; $25,000.00<br>Albany Task Force Convener&#160;&#160; $5,000.00<br>Amsterdam Task Force Convener&#160; $8,017.50<br>Director's stipend&#160;&#160; $39,450.00<br>Director Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Course releases&#160; $20,000.00<br>Endowed Chair/Empire Innovation Professor&#160; $25,000.00<br>Presidential Forum on Health Disparities&#160; $12,000.00<br>Venue rental with audio/visual&#160; $2,500.00<br>CEMHD newsletter translation services&#160; $1,200.00<br>Printing costs for newsletter&#160; $2,500.00<br>Office supplies&#160; $2,000.00<br>Mail/Postage&#160; $500.00<br>Computers/printers&#160; $5,000.00<br>Rapid copy&#160; $1,000.00<br>Catering&#160; $3,500.00<br>NIH funded S-21 Total&#160; $620,851.34<br><br>Projected expenditures from Hearst Foundation<br>Tuition &amp; fees (NYS rate) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#160; $75,543.75<br>Stipend (no fringe) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#160;&#160; $106,182.00<br>Travel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#160;&#160; $10,000.00<br>Travel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Primary mentors&#160; $10,000.00<br>Travel for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Rotational mentors&#160; $2,500.00<br>Overhead fee (7.5%) to transfer stipend money from UAF to IFR&#160; $7,963.65<br>Hearst Foundation Total&#160; $212,189.40</div></span><br></div></div>","stateHeadcount":"3","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"1.8","rfNumber":"","proposals1":"","proposals2":"","proposals3":"","awards1":"","awards2":"","awards3":"","largeScale1":"","largeScale2":"","sttrAwards1":"","sttrAwards2":"","publication1":"","publication2":"","publication3":"","technologyTransfer1":"","technologyTransfer2":"","technologyTransfer3":"","technologyTransfer4":"","technologyTransfer5":"","technologyTransfer6":"","technologyTransfer7":"","conference":"","educationAndTraining1":"","educationAndTraining2":"","educationAndTraining3":"","educationAndTraining4":"","goal1":"<div class=\"ExternalClassE2107F650E804BB4B4BE1A71C7DAA154\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<span style=\"font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);color&#58;black;\">​</span><span style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);display&#58;inline !important;\">Provide continuing support to Health Disparities Fellows in the form of stipends, tuition and fees, writing and statistics support, and conference travel support.

Over the past five years, ASRC’s payroll expenditures totaled $10,706,372 – an average of $2,141,274 per year. One full-time research facilitator and one part-time IT support person are supported by the VPR. Post-docs, research scientists, visiting scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students are primarily paid from research grants; some are supported from start-up funds provided to SUNY2020 faculty. Most ASRC faculty are on 9-month academic year appointments and are paid summer salary from research grants or start-up funds. OTPS&#58; ASRC’s operations, including operations at the UAlbany location and at Whiteface Mountain, are covered by IFR revenue recovered from sponsored programs. Over the past five years, ASRC’s OTPS expenditures at the Albany location have totaled $202,696, an average of $40,539 per year. Not counting annual telephone charges of almost $19,000 per year, OTPS expenses at ASRC average about $21,539 per year. The Whiteface location’s OTPS expenditures over five years total $77,606, an average of $15,521 per year. One faculty member had a legacy IFR account that covered some OTPS expenses such as Verizon Wireless. Strategic Investment&#58; In the past, ASRC has received overhead recovery from the VPR to be used to grow research activity at ASRC. We have about $70,900 remaining in cash to spend on the state-side. On the RF side there is a legacy overhead recovery account primarily used in support of our RF p-card program as the initial source to pay the Bank of America bill monthly; expenses are then moved to the appropriate sponsored award through a reconciliation process. Events&#58; ASRC has both UAlbany Foundation funds in the Ray Falconer Endowment and UAS (Auxiliary Services) funds to support lectures and colloquies.</span></span><br></div></div>","stateHeadcount":"22","rfHeadcount":"68","stateNumber":"20.68","rfNumber":"51.65","proposals1":"24.2","proposals2":"","proposals3":"","awards1":"","awards2":"","awards3":"","largeScale1":"","largeScale2":"","sttrAwards1":"","sttrAwards2":"","publication1":"","publication2":"","publication3":"","technologyTransfer1":"","technologyTransfer2":"","technologyTransfer3":"","technologyTransfer4":"","technologyTransfer5":"","technologyTransfer6":"","technologyTransfer7":"","conference":"","educationAndTraining1":"","educationAndTraining2":"","educationAndTraining3":"","educationAndTraining4":"","goal1":"<div class=\"ExternalClass07D4BFD9CC4E4EAFA364D5CE5D8FAC67\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​</span>Maintain strengths and establish new research strengths (in wake of upcoming retirements)&#58;<br></div><div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\">• Renewable Energy/Grid Resiliency<br>• Atmospheric Chemistry (including Whiteface activity)<br>• Climate<br>• Urban Environment and Health<br>• AI applications in Atmospheric Sciences<br>• Hydrology (including water resources, flooding applications</div></span><br></div></div>","goal2":"","goal3":"","goal4":"","goal5":"","actions1":"<div class=\"ExternalClassB25E474CFCC94B3EAE493E82A2B746BE\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​</span>Through interdisciplinary collaborations pursue funding from all applicable federal, state, and private sources within these research strengths.<br></div><div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br>Seek hires in faculty, students and staff to contribute to these themes.</div></span><br></div></div>","actions2":"","actions3":"","actions4":"","actions5":"","metrics1":"Metrics include:   (i) New Grants, (ii) Published papers and white papers, (iii) successful recruitment","metrics2":"","metrics3":"","metrics4":"","metrics5":"","timeframe1":"May 2023","timeframe2":"","timeframe3":"","timeframe4":"","timeframe5":"","primaryLeader1":"Chris Thorncroft in collaboration with Research Theme Leaders","primaryLeader2":"","primaryLeader3":"","primaryLeader4":"","primaryLeader5":"","impactWorkplan1":"","impactWorkplan2":"","impactWorkplan3":"","impactWorkplan4":"","impactWorkplan5":"","collaboratingUnits1":"","collaboratingUnits2":"","collaboratingUnits3":"","collaboratingUnits4":"","collaboratingUnits5":"","impactResearchExcellence1":"","impactResearchExcellence2":"","impactResearchExcellence3":"","impactResearchExcellence4":"","impactResearchExcellence5":""}}],"FY":"FY 22-23"}
