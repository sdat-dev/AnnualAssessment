(CTG UAlbany) was established in 1993 to pursue new ways to use technology to address practical problems of information management and service delivery in government. It soon developed into an internationally-recognized research center within the University at Albany whose mission is to foster public sector innovation, enhance capability, generate public value, and support good governance. To achieve this mission, CTG UAlbany pursues the following strategic actions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n• To engage in innovative academic and applied research on complex societal challenges\r\n• To become global leaders in digital government research and public sector digital transformation\r\n• To develop and teach innovative courses that emphasize real-life applications of technology, management, policy, and data in the public sector\r\n• To enable students to learn about societal challenges and apply technologies and policies in the context of specific projects\r\n• To engage diverse professional communities in the transformation of public services\r\n\r\nCTG UAlbany's competitive advantage\r\n\r\n• Unique combination of disciplines (public administration and public management, computer science, information systems, data science, business, international relations)\r\n• Highly skilled academic and professional staff, who help bridge the gap between academia and practice by addressing public problems that are academically significant and practically relevant\r\n• Network orchestrator, locally (government organizations, diverse stakeholders) and internationally (leader of multiple research networks)\r\n• Co-creation approach in projects with government organizations that enable their engagement in creative problem-solving processes and the implementation of innovative and customized digital transformation solutions to complex problems\r\n• “Center for Technology in Government” as a worldwide recognized “brand” developed and consolidated during the last 30 years\r\n• Key location, close to decision-makers and international hubs</div>","annualBudget":"CTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG will realize $429,245 in IFR revenue from seven RF projects and $265,182 from four state-side MOUs and contracts. Due to an overpayment on our Water Quality project by the sponsor, $115,255 of these funds were returned to the DEC. In addition, $68,294 in At-Risk Funding was returned by the budget office to our IFR account. Finally, total state overhead paid on these awards was $64,927. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG FY 2021-2022 was $582,539. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $435,025. The expense categories included phones, technical equipment and software, postage, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. This figure also includes fringe for all non-student categories. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. CTG’s PSR state allocation of $680,857supported 6.34 FTEs. This was reduced by $176,318 from last year’s state allocation of $857,175 and 8 FTEs in order to help support the state-side budget deficit. Due to these reductions in state supported PSR, this year CTG needed to use IFR funds to support 2 research-related positions in order to continue the work needed on various research awards, including a researcher in digital government and a program associate. CTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $923,419 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures (Phase II) award for $349,945 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation (Part 2) award for $39,000. Total new state awards equaled $388,945. New awards through the Research Foundation included a 3-year Message Design Dashboard: Development of a Standardized Messaging Tool through FEMA at $327,012 for year 1. Also, the City of Schenectady awarded the project, Enabling the State-Wide Rollout of the Share Regional Information Resource in the amount of $189,462. The NYS Association of Counties awarded CTG $16,000 to develop a Cyber Primer for local IT leaders. In addition, we received a gift in kind from NVIDIA to provide equipment and training for the TAF project already underway and is valued at approximately $2,000. Total New RF awards equaled $923,419. In addition, CTG has two proposals pending including the NSF Large-scale CoPe: Bridging Data to Action - Using Data and AI to Develop Equitable Outcomes While Augmenting Resilience to Climate Hazards in Coastal Communities for $864,923. Also submitted was a proposal to NSF for the Civic Innovation Challenge 2022 Planning Grant in coordination with the City of Schenectady for $50,000. Total potential new revenue awarded in the coming fiscal year totals $914,923. Residual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.","stateHeadcount":"11","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"10.25","rfNumber":"","additionalAmount1":"$429,245","additionalSource1":"910029-00 ","additionalAmount2":"$265,182 (before refund of overpayment from DEC & return of at-risk holding as noted above.)","additionalSource2":"900309-00","additionalAmount3":"$1,011","additionalSource3":"20-50013-00 ","federalApplicationsGoal":"2","privateApplicationsGoal":"0","stateApplicationsGoal":"3","federalApplicationsActual":"4","privateApplicationsActual":"0","stateApplicationsActual":"0","federalAwardsGoal":"","privateAwardsGoal":"","stateAwardsGoal":"","federalAwardsActual":"","privateAwardsActual":"","stateAwardsActual":"","lsProposalsGoal":"0","lsProposalsActual":"0","lsAwardsGoal":"0","lsAwardsActual":"0","sttrProposalsGoal":"","sttrProposalsActual":"","sttrAwardssGoal":"","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"","booksAuthoredActual":"","bookChaptersGoal":"","bookChaptersActual":"","publicationsGoal":"","publicationsActual":"","listOfPublications":"<div class=\"ExternalClassA9D5008CA71F4D5AB34566AC8E529320\">​\r\n\r\n​1.

It soon developed into an internationally-recognized research center within the University at Albany whose mission is to foster public sector innovation, enhance capability, generate public value, and support good governance. To achieve this mission, CTG UAlbany pursues the following strategic actions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n• To engage in innovative academic and applied research on complex societal challenges\r\n• To become global leaders in digital government research and public sector digital transformation\r\n• To develop and teach innovative courses that emphasize real-life applications of technology, management, policy, and data in the public sector\r\n• To enable students to learn about societal challenges and apply technologies and policies in the context of specific projects\r\n• To engage diverse professional communities in the transformation of public services\r\n\r\nCTG UAlbany's competitive advantage\r\n\r\n• Unique combination of disciplines (public administration and public management, computer science, information systems, data science, business, international relations)\r\n• Highly skilled academic and professional staff, who help bridge the gap between academia and practice by addressing public problems that are academically significant and practically relevant\r\n• Network orchestrator, locally (government organizations, diverse stakeholders) and internationally (leader of multiple research networks)\r\n• Co-creation approach in projects with government organizations that enable their engagement in creative problem-solving processes and the implementation of innovative and customized digital transformation solutions to complex problems\r\n• “Center for Technology in Government” as a worldwide recognized “brand” developed and consolidated during the last 30 years\r\n• Key location, close to decision-makers and international hubs</div>","annualBudget":"<div class=\"ExternalClass65C980E7E3E449CEBABDF7CF3BA657E3\">​​CTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG will realize $429,245 in IFR revenue from seven RF projects and $265,182 from four state-side MOUs and contracts. Due to an overpayment on our Water Quality project by the sponsor, $115,255 of these funds were returned to the DEC. In addition, $68,294 in At-Risk Funding was returned by the budget office to our IFR account. Finally, total state overhead paid on these awards was $64,927. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG FY 2021-2022 was $582,539. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $435,025. The expense categories included phones, technical equipment and software, postage, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. This figure also includes fringe for all non-student categories. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. CTG’s PSR state allocation of $680,857supported 6.34 FTEs. This was reduced by $176,318 from last year’s state allocation of $857,175 and 8 FTEs in order to help support the state-side budget deficit. Due to these reductions in state supported PSR, this year CTG needed to use IFR funds to support 2 research-related positions in order to continue the work needed on various research awards, including a researcher in digital government and a program associate. CTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $923,419 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures (Phase II) award for $349,945 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation (Part 2) award for $39,000. Total new state awards equaled $388,945. New awards through the Research Foundation included a 3-year Message Design Dashboard Development of a Standardized Messaging Tool through FEMA at $327,012 for year 1. Also, the City of Schenectady awarded the project, Enabling the State-Wide Rollout of the Share Regional Information Resource in the amount of $189,462. The NYS Association of Counties awarded CTG $16,000 to develop a Cyber Primer for local IT leaders. In addition, we received a gift in kind from NVIDIA to provide equipment and training for the TAF project already underway and is valued at approximately $2,000. Total New RF awards equaled $923,419. In addition, CTG has two proposals pending including the NSF Large-scale CoPe Bridging Data to Action - Using Data and AI to Develop Equitable Outcomes While Augmenting Resilience to Climate Hazards in Coastal Communities for $864,923. Also submitted was a proposal to NSF for the Civic Innovation Challenge 2022 Planning Grant in coordination with the City of Schenectady for $50,000. Total potential new revenue awarded in the coming fiscal year totals $914,923. Residual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.</div>","stateHeadcount":"11","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"10.25","rfNumber":"","proposals1":"1","proposals2":"1","proposals3":"1","awards1":"1","awards2":"1","awards3":"1","largeScale1":"1","largeScale2":"1","sttrAwards1":"","sttrAwards2":"","publication1":"","publication2":"","publication3":"","technologyTransfer1":"","technologyTransfer2":"","technologyTransfer3":"","technologyTransfer4":"","technologyTransfer5":"","technologyTransfer6":"","technologyTransfer7":"","conference":"","educationAndTraining1":"","educationAndTraining2":"","educationAndTraining3":"","educationAndTraining4":"","goal1":"<div class=\"ExternalClass3B03E955D4CB407595F03FCCA780D3E7\">​​Engage in innovative research and problem solving projects that address societal challenges</div>","goal2":"<div class=\"ExternalClassFAB6BFB760EC40F59B4ED0D7EEE22A7B\">1</div>","goal3":"<div class=\"ExternalClass07A7152066BF4B62B224330EA60AE521\">1</div>","goal4":"","goal5":"","actions1":"<div class=\"ExternalClassA1B84F1456F147F7BC5A19462D4415E6\">​​Strategically plan for and submit 5 research and other project proposals and contracts.</div>","actions2":"","actions3":"","actions4":"","actions5":"","metrics1":"Five applications processed.","metrics2":"","metrics3":"","metrics4":"","metrics5":"","timeframe1":"CTG Management Team","timeframe2":"","timeframe3":"","timeframe4":"","timeframe5":"","primaryLeader1":"CTG Management Team","primaryLeader2":"","primaryLeader3":"","primaryLeader4":"","primaryLeader5":"","impactWorkplan1":"","impactWorkplan2":"","impactWorkplan3":"","impactWorkplan4":"","impactWorkplan5":"","collaboratingUnits1":"","collaboratingUnits2":"","collaboratingUnits3":"","collaboratingUnits4":"","collaboratingUnits5":"","impactResearchExcellence1":"","impactResearchExcellence2":"","impactResearchExcellence3":"","impactResearchExcellence4":"","impactResearchExcellence5":""}},{"Unit":"Center for Social & Demographic Analysis","FY 22-23":{"unit":"Center for Social & Demographic Analysis","year":"FY 22-23","lastName":"Friedman","firstName":"Samantha","email":"samfriedman@albany.edu","mission":"<div>CSDA's mission is to facilitate and organize population research and education of the highest caliber.

Home to a 2016 NIMHD S21 Health Disparities Endowment Grant, a 2009 NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center of Excellence, and a 2004 NIMHD R24 EXPORT Center, CEMHD works toward eliminating health disparities by developing capacity in faculty at the University at Albany and partnering with community groups to identify their health concerns and the sources of disparities, and then plans, implements and tests strategies to alleviate them. CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany. CEMHD's focus on minorities and under-served populations in the smaller cities and towns of Upstate New York is premised upon the notion that health disparities found in these areas differ from those in the larger cities, and that the appropriate solutions will also differ. Since most of the research on minority health disparities, and the programs that have resulted from it, has focused on populations in large cities, relatively little is known about the distinct causes of poorer health among minorities in smaller cities. Therefore, another reason for our geographical emphasis is to fill in a gap in the research and to initiate and test the appropriate solutions.</span></span><br></div></div>","annualBudget":"Projected CEMHD ANNUAL Expenditures\nProjected expenditures from NIH funded S-21                                                         \nStipend and fringe for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $143,982.90 \nTuition and fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $91,966.09\nTravel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $12,000.00 \nTravel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Primary mentors  $12,000.00\nTravel for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Rotational mentors  $3,000.00 \nWriting support for Health Disparities Fellows  $7,890.00\nStatistical support for Health Disparities Fellows (grad student)  $6,698.64 \nSupport for advancing MHD research (grad student)  $11,164.40\nSupport for collaboration/recruitment platform development (grad student)  $24,091.60 \nLogistical support & Task Force liaison (grad student)  $25,854.40\nAssociate Director of Operations and Research   $129,535.81 \nSupport for Community Task Force   $25,000.00\nAlbany Task Force Convener   $5,000.00 \nAmsterdam Task Force Convener  $8,017.50\nDirector's stipend   $39,450.00 \nDirector Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Course releases  $20,000.00 \nEndowed Chair/Empire Innovation Professor  $25,000.00 \nPresidential Forum on Health Disparities  $12,000.00\nVenue rental with audio/visual  $2,500.00 \nCEMHD newsletter translation services  $1,200.00 \nPrinting costs for newsletter  $2,500.00\nOffice supplies  $2,000.00 \nMail/Postage  $500.00\nComputers/printers  $5,000.00 \nRapid copy  $1,000.00 \nCatering  $3,500.00\nNIH funded S-21 Total  $620,851.34\n\nProjected expenditures from Hearst Foundation\nTuition & fees (NYS rate) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows  $75,543.75\nStipend (no fringe) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows   $106,182.00 \nTravel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows   $10,000.00\nTravel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Primary mentors  $10,000.00 \nTravel for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Rotational mentors  $2,500.00\nOverhead fee (7.5%) to transfer stipend money from UAF to IFR  $7,963.65\nHearst Foundation Total  $212,189.40\n","stateHeadcount":"3","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"1.8","rfNumber":"","additionalAmount1":"","additionalSource1":"","additionalAmount2":"","additionalSource2":"","additionalAmount3":"","additionalSource3":"","federalApplicationsGoal":"","privateApplicationsGoal":"","stateApplicationsGoal":"","federalApplicationsActual":"","privateApplicationsActual":"","stateApplicationsActual":"","federalAwardsGoal":"","privateAwardsGoal":"","stateAwardsGoal":"","federalAwardsActual":"","privateAwardsActual":"","stateAwardsActual":"","lsProposalsGoal":"","lsProposalsActual":"","lsAwardsGoal":"","lsAwardsActual":"","sttrProposalsGoal":"","sttrProposalsActual":"","sttrAwardssGoal":"","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"","booksAuthoredActual":"","bookChaptersGoal":"","bookChaptersActual":"","publicationsGoal":"","publicationsActual":"42","listOfPublications":"<div class=\"ExternalClass5A310DC4E2284A78BE53887E8FB14B3A\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​</span>In Press Peer Reviewed Publications (Health Disparity Training Fellows (HDTFS)<br></div><div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br>1.

Home to a 2016 NIMHD S21 Health Disparities Endowment Grant, a 2009 NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center of Excellence, and a 2004 NIMHD R24 EXPORT Center, CEMHD works toward eliminating health disparities by developing capacity in faculty at the University at Albany and partnering with community groups to identify their health concerns and the sources of disparities, and then plans, implements and tests strategies to alleviate them. CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany. CEMHD's focus on minorities and under-served populations in the smaller cities and towns of Upstate New York is premised upon the notion that health disparities found in these areas differ from those in the larger cities, and that the appropriate solutions will also differ. Since most of the research on minority health disparities, and the programs that have resulted from it, has focused on populations in large cities, relatively little is known about the distinct causes of poorer health among minorities in smaller cities. Therefore, another reason for our geographical emphasis is to fill in a gap in the research and to initiate and test the appropriate solutions.</span></span><br></div></div>","annualBudget":"<div class=\"ExternalClassB555B4CE380D490B88077C10483DFA4E\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​</span>Projected CEMHD ANNUAL Expenditures<br></div><div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Projected expenditures from NIH funded S-21&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Stipend and fringe for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#160; $143,982.90<br>Tuition and fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#160; $91,966.09<br>Travel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#160; $12,000.00<br>Travel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Primary mentors&#160; $12,000.00<br>Travel for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Rotational mentors&#160; $3,000.00<br>Writing support for Health Disparities Fellows&#160; $7,890.00<br>Statistical support for Health Disparities Fellows (grad student)&#160; $6,698.64<br>Support for advancing MHD research (grad student)&#160; $11,164.40<br>Support for collaboration/recruitment platform development (grad student)&#160; $24,091.60<br>Logistical support &amp; Task Force liaison (grad student)&#160; $25,854.40<br>Associate Director of Operations and Research&#160;&#160; $129,535.81<br>Support for Community Task Force&#160;&#160; $25,000.00<br>Albany Task Force Convener&#160;&#160; $5,000.00<br>Amsterdam Task Force Convener&#160; $8,017.50<br>Director's stipend&#160;&#160; $39,450.00<br>Director Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Course releases&#160; $20,000.00<br>Endowed Chair/Empire Innovation Professor&#160; $25,000.00<br>Presidential Forum on Health Disparities&#160; $12,000.00<br>Venue rental with audio/visual&#160; $2,500.00<br>CEMHD newsletter translation services&#160; $1,200.00<br>Printing costs for newsletter&#160; $2,500.00<br>Office supplies&#160; $2,000.00<br>Mail/Postage&#160; $500.00<br>Computers/printers&#160; $5,000.00<br>Rapid copy&#160; $1,000.00<br>Catering&#160; $3,500.00<br>NIH funded S-21 Total&#160; $620,851.34<br><br>Projected expenditures from Hearst Foundation<br>Tuition &amp; fees (NYS rate) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#160; $75,543.75<br>Stipend (no fringe) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#160;&#160; $106,182.00<br>Travel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#160;&#160; $10,000.00<br>Travel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Primary mentors&#160; $10,000.00<br>Travel for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Rotational mentors&#160; $2,500.00<br>Overhead fee (7.5%) to transfer stipend money from UAF to IFR&#160; $7,963.65<br>Hearst Foundation Total&#160; $212,189.40</div></span><br></div></div>","stateHeadcount":"3","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"1.8","rfNumber":"","proposals1":"","proposals2":"","proposals3":"","awards1":"","awards2":"","awards3":"","largeScale1":"","largeScale2":"","sttrAwards1":"","sttrAwards2":"","publication1":"","publication2":"","publication3":"","technologyTransfer1":"","technologyTransfer2":"","technologyTransfer3":"","technologyTransfer4":"","technologyTransfer5":"","technologyTransfer6":"","technologyTransfer7":"","conference":"","educationAndTraining1":"","educationAndTraining2":"","educationAndTraining3":"","educationAndTraining4":"","goal1":"<div class=\"ExternalClassE2107F650E804BB4B4BE1A71C7DAA154\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<span style=\"font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);color&#58;black;\">​</span><span style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);display&#58;inline !important;\">Provide continuing support to Health Disparities Fellows in the form of stipends, tuition and fees, writing and statistics support, and conference travel support.

Over the past five years, ASRC’s payroll expenditures totaled $10,706,372 – an average of $2,141,274 per year. One full-time research facilitator and one part-time IT support person are supported by the VPR. Post-docs, research scientists, visiting scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students are primarily paid from research grants; some are supported from start-up funds provided to SUNY2020 faculty. Most ASRC faculty are on 9-month academic year appointments and are paid summer salary from research grants or start-up funds. OTPS&#58; ASRC’s operations, including operations at the UAlbany location and at Whiteface Mountain, are covered by IFR revenue recovered from sponsored programs. Over the past five years, ASRC’s OTPS expenditures at the Albany location have totaled $202,696, an average of $40,539 per year. Not counting annual telephone charges of almost $19,000 per year, OTPS expenses at ASRC average about $21,539 per year. The Whiteface location’s OTPS expenditures over five years total $77,606, an average of $15,521 per year. One faculty member had a legacy IFR account that covered some OTPS expenses such as Verizon Wireless. Strategic Investment&#58; In the past, ASRC has received overhead recovery from the VPR to be used to grow research activity at ASRC. We have about $70,900 remaining in cash to spend on the state-side. On the RF side there is a legacy overhead recovery account primarily used in support of our RF p-card program as the initial source to pay the Bank of America bill monthly; expenses are then moved to the appropriate sponsored award through a reconciliation process. Events&#58; ASRC has both UAlbany Foundation funds in the Ray Falconer Endowment and UAS (Auxiliary Services) funds to support lectures and colloquies.</span></span><br></div></div>","stateHeadcount":"22","rfHeadcount":"68","stateNumber":"20.68","rfNumber":"51.65","proposals1":"24.2","proposals2":"","proposals3":"","awards1":"","awards2":"","awards3":"","largeScale1":"","largeScale2":"","sttrAwards1":"","sttrAwards2":"","publication1":"","publication2":"","publication3":"","technologyTransfer1":"","technologyTransfer2":"","technologyTransfer3":"","technologyTransfer4":"","technologyTransfer5":"","technologyTransfer6":"","technologyTransfer7":"","conference":"","educationAndTraining1":"","educationAndTraining2":"","educationAndTraining3":"","educationAndTraining4":"","goal1":"<div class=\"ExternalClass07D4BFD9CC4E4EAFA364D5CE5D8FAC67\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​</span>Maintain strengths and establish new research strengths (in wake of upcoming retirements)&#58;<br></div><div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\">• Renewable Energy/Grid Resiliency<br>• Atmospheric Chemistry (including Whiteface activity)<br>• Climate<br>• Urban Environment and Health<br>• AI applications in Atmospheric Sciences<br>• Hydrology (including water resources, flooding applications</div></span><br></div></div>","goal2":"","goal3":"","goal4":"","goal5":"","actions1":"<div class=\"ExternalClassB25E474CFCC94B3EAE493E82A2B746BE\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​</span>Through interdisciplinary collaborations pursue funding from all applicable federal, state, and private sources within these research strengths.<br></div><div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br>Seek hires in faculty, students and staff to contribute to these themes.</div></span><br></div></div>","actions2":"","actions3":"","actions4":"","actions5":"","metrics1":"Metrics include:   (i) New Grants, (ii) Published papers and white papers, (iii) successful recruitment","metrics2":"","metrics3":"","metrics4":"","metrics5":"","timeframe1":"May 2023","timeframe2":"","timeframe3":"","timeframe4":"","timeframe5":"","primaryLeader1":"Chris Thorncroft in collaboration with Research Theme Leaders","primaryLeader2":"","primaryLeader3":"","primaryLeader4":"","primaryLeader5":"","impactWorkplan1":"","impactWorkplan2":"","impactWorkplan3":"","impactWorkplan4":"","impactWorkplan5":"","collaboratingUnits1":"","collaboratingUnits2":"","collaboratingUnits3":"","collaboratingUnits4":"","collaboratingUnits5":"","impactResearchExcellence1":"","impactResearchExcellence2":"","impactResearchExcellence3":"","impactResearchExcellence4":"","impactResearchExcellence5":""}}],"FY":"FY 22-23"}
