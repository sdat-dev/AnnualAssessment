projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG UAlbany will realize $234,166 in IFR revenue from two RF projects and $294,690 from two state-side MOUs and contracts. A budget reduction of $50,000 and a $5,100 transfer to VPRED to cover their telephone/IT expense reduced our state-side revue to $254,690.  In addition, total state overhead paid on these awards will be $17,562 and $44,204, respectively, for a total of $61,766. Finally, fringe on both accounts will be $38,969 and $36,389 respectively, for a total of $75,358. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG UAlbany FY 2022-2023 will be $336,633. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $301,812. The expense categories included technical equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG UAlbany. We do not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead we revenue generates on our own to support our OTPS budget. We also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $16,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. Our PSR state allocation of $664,650 supported 6.25 FTEs. This year we did not have the Applications Developer position as part of our PSR. The incumbent left the end of the last fiscal year and our attempt to replace them resulted in a failed search. We therefore utilized his line to move the remaining Director of Administration and Finance line over to PSR along with a portion of the CTG Director’s line. Due to the lack of IT support, we invested a much higher percentage of our IFR line to graduate and student assistants who could help fill this critical gap. The savings due to the partial movements of the two lines over to PSR helped to mitigate this cost. \n\nCTG UAlbany continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. \n\nThis year we submitted two grant proposals totaling $1,385,119 which are currently pending. The first was submitted to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for an Accountable Institutions and Behavior grant entitled, “Accountability in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” in the amount of $749,867. The second was a 3-year grant submitted to the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for a National Leadership Grant for Libraries entitled, “Empowering Communities: Public Libraries, Civic Engagement and Artificial Intelligence” in the amount of $635,252.  Residual funds not utilized in this fiscal year will be used next year and in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.  \n","stateHeadcount":"8","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"7.25","rfNumber":"","additionalAmount1":"$239,088","additionalSource1":"910029-00 ","additionalAmount2":"$278,544 (Before budget adjustments of $50K for a budget reduction and $5,100 telephone/IT transfer, as noted above.)","additionalSource2":"900309-00","additionalAmount3":"$975","additionalSource3":"20-50013-00 ","federalApplicationsGoal":"2","privateApplicationsGoal":"1","stateApplicationsGoal":"2","federalApplicationsActual":"2","privateApplicationsActual":"0","stateApplicationsActual":"0","federalAwardsGoal":"1","privateAwardsGoal":"0","stateAwardsGoal":"1","federalAwardsActual":"0","privateAwardsActual":"0","stateAwardsActual":"0","lsProposalsGoal":"1","lsProposalsActual":"0","lsAwardsGoal":"0","lsAwardsActual":"0","sttrProposalsGoal":"0","sttrProposalsActual":"0","sttrAwardssGoal":"0","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"1","booksAuthoredActual":"1","bookChaptersGoal":"0","bookChaptersActual":"0","publicationsGoal":"10","publicationsActual":"22","listOfPublications":"<div class=\"ExternalClass7E4F55192EDF44BF9B028491FE784573\">​1.\tCook, Meghan, IT Departments&#58; Leading Digital Transformation in NYS Counties, NYS Association of Counties Magazine, Spring 2023 \n2.\tCook, Meghan, Building Cybersecurity Readiness in NYS Local Governments, NYCOM Municipal Matters, Winter 2022\n3.\tBuyannemekh, Battulga Cook, M.E.

The first, titled, “AI Impact on Bureaucratic Accountability and Accountability to Citizens” and submitted to the National Science Foundation (NSF) Accountable Institutions and Behavior Program. The second, “Empowering Communities&#58; Public Libraries, Civic Engagement, and Artificial Intelligence was submitted to Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership Grants for Libraries Program. These research proposals not only build on our expertise on digital government but are also aligned with the university’s recent AI initiative, which we consider an important achievement.\n\nIn addition, we are still successfully implementing and managing existing research projects, very well aligned as well with the university’s research priorities. At the federal level, through a $2.8 million contract from the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), researchers from CTG UAlbany and the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity (CEHC) are developing a Message Design Dashboard system for FEMA to help emergency managers write more effective messages for public alert and warning. Similarly, CTG UAlbany and the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences are collaborating in a research project funded by a five-year $1,494,805 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to help improve emergency communications and preparedness in rural areas in upstate New York. At the state level, with total funding to date of $636,834 from the New York State Board of Elections (NYS BOE), CTG UAlbany, leading a multi institution team with UAlbany CEHC, Albany Law School Government Law Center and industry experts IDC, started the third of three projects focused on the security and resiliency of technical and organizational elections infrastructure in NYS. Further, with total funding of $410,417 from New York State, CTG UAlbany completed a six year project that we led with the City of Schenectady on behalf of the Cities of Gloversville, Amsterdam, Troy, and Cortland. The project resulted in the development of the C.O.D.E., a data sharing platform designed to identify problem actors (landlords, LLCS, agents) so that local governments can inform their blight reduction strategies. Towards the conclusion of the project, CTG UAlbany successfully transitioned the role we played in the project to the City of Schenectady to help ensure the ongoing operation and growth of the C.O.D.E. to other local governments in New York State.\n</div>","topAchievements2":"<div class=\"ExternalClassD1440ED8535E46188966444D7DF3B17E\">2. Maintained and Grew CTG UAlbany Recognition’s as a Global Leader in Digital Transformation in Government Research by Serving as Invited Speakers at and Playing Leadership Roles in International Conferences, Meetings, and other Engagements\n\nWe accomplished important milestones in terms of visibility and expansion of our international network by accepting a mix of international keynote invitations (for example, during the Open Government Week in Peru, the First Innovation and Smart Government Conference (ISGOV) in Mexico, or the Smart City Expo in Spain). In addition, we participated in several international panels and conferences presenting our research and meeting several of our dissemination goals. We also served in leadership roles in a number of the leading international digital government and public administration conferences to include 23th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research (dg.o 2022), IFIP EGOV 2022, The Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), and the International Research Society for Public Management (IRSPM).\n</div>","topAchievements3":"<div class=\"ExternalClass383A7A0A407C446E85850321BD481FA9\">3.\tDeveloped a Technology Innovation to Support Government Services, which could be potentially commercialized\nSUNY Technology Accelerator Fund (TAF) Community Asset Tracker Application\nNew developments have been made to the Community Asset Tracker application, for which CTG UAlbany is using a $50,000 SUNY Technology Accelerator Fund investment. The Community Asset Tracker uses a mobile artificial intelligence driven sensor network to track government assets. CTG UAlbany is using the CAT and our efforts to help communities evaluate and implement the system to improve government operations and services. Work in this respect has been started with the City of Schenectady. The progress made in the development of the CAT is an accomplishment that will help us submit a new research proposal to the NSF’s Smart and Connected Communities Program in the next few months, therefore contributing to the achievement of some of our research goals. Further, CTG UAlbany’s aim is to commercialize the technology through licensing to a startup or existing company, expanding its reach. And, therefore, also contributing to the university’s economic development goals.\n</div>","topAchievements4":"<div class=\"ExternalClass300AAFE55BD44E13B5492AE7B758A107\">4.\tEngaged Students in Research and Practice Projects\n\nCTG UAlbany provides students with valuable research experience working on projects with CTG researchers, government partners, and mix of federal, state, and international research funders. For 2022-2023, CTG UAlbany trained approximately 16 undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students and provided approximately $196,427 in salaries and tuition from external RF awards and State MOUs. The training provided helped students to contribute to CTG Albany’s research agenda in a variety of ways and, therefore, this is an important accomplishment in terms of our research goals.\n</div>","topAchievements5":"<div class=\"ExternalClassFD337B9A030A4292A26FF8E5423739BC\">5.\tDeveloped a New UAlbany Faculty Fellows Program\n\nAt the request of the new UAlbany Vice President for Research and Economic Development, CTG UAlbany developed and launched a formal faculty fellows program to help facilitate meaningful research collaborations among UAlbany faculty researchers around the topics of information and technology in government. This program has been one of our major accomplishments, not only in terms of putting it together, but also in terms of increasing our visibility within the University, making new connections and leveraging opportunities for further interdisciplinary and meaningful research, well aligned with the University’s priorities. We successfully increased our number of faculty fellows from 3 to 23 representing 10 different departments at UAlbany.

Some of these priorities revolve around the topics of artificial intelligence, security and resiliency of critical infrastructure, data analytics, emergency preparedness and response, cybersecurity, and digital inclusion. Potential future projects may take advantage of this opportunity. First, regarding artificial intelligence, in January 2023 we submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation Accountable Institutions and Behavior program that will explore the changes to public vertical and horizontal accountability brought about by AI-based automated decision-making processes. Second, in March 2023 we submitted a research proposal to the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences aimed to understand the role of public libraries in fostering inclusive civic engagement in all aspects of artificial intelligence. At the time of writing we are preparing a third proposal (due in September 2023) for the National Science Foundation Science of Organizations program that will study the impact of the use of AI systems in the internal organizational dynamics of public organizations. Second, on the topic of elections infrastructure, CTG UAlbany led the fourth funded project with the New York State Board of Elections. This project is in alignment with UAlbany’s strategic goal of security and resiliency and cybersecurity as we help state and county leaders envision a more secure technical infrastructure for voter registrations and all elections related functions.\n\nCalls from federal agencies are increasingly interdisciplinary and CTG UAlbany is in a unique position to contribute to the socio-technical aspects of information and technology in government. The potential projects above are also examples of how CTG UAlbany is contributing to important topics from an interdisciplinary perspective.\n\nUAlbany’s prioritization (and therefore available support) of commercialization efforts is also an opportunity for CTG UAlbany. Given the type of work we do, several of our projects’ results and outcomes may be commercialize, which could potentially increase revenue, but also benefit society as a whole. This particularly applies to our SUNY Technology Accelerator Fund Community Asset Tracker (CAT) project. We currently are working with the City of Schenectady to deploy and test the CAT sensors throughout the City. In addition, we are planning to submit a new research proposal focused on the CAT to the NSF Smart and Connected Communities (S&amp;CC) program by spring 2024.\n\nThe hiring initiative that is bringing to UAlbany 27 new faculty with a focus on AI in multiple disciplines may also be an opportunity for CTG UAlbany and its new faculty fellows program. New faculty across the university may be invited to be part of our fellows program, which may result in higher research productivity from an inter-disciplinary perspective (more research proposals submitted to federal agencies, more articles in journals from diverse disciplines, more conference papers, etc.) and, therefore, in strengthening the focus on AI as a distinctive feature of UAlbany.\n</div>","bigChallenges":"<div class=\"ExternalClassBE6AE847B89744289428A4E6A23F29DF\">The number of competitors in the form of other academic research centers outside of UAlbany and private sector consultants is growing. More of these organizations have a focus on digital transformation research and applications (CTG UAlbany’s area of expertise) and in particular on the topic of artificial intelligence, although their interest in these topics is often linked to the available opportunities rather than to real expertise/experience on those topics. In this respect, they compete with us in terms of state funding, federal research dollars, and foundation funding.\n\nThere are university imposed financial constraints, which impact our ability to attract and retain talent which in turn affects our ability to generate knowledge, build capability, and disseminate information in a sustainable way. Long term positions have turned into short term and soft funded positions that result in high rotation and the need for retraining. Other positions, such as the Communications Manager, have completely disappeared, hindering our capacity to efficiently disseminate our work nationally and internationally, as we have in the past, and gain visibility for both CTG UAlbany and the university as a whole. This creates an ongoing challenge.\n\nFinding PhD students to work in our projects has become harder than before. Given that we do not exactly know when a project may receive funding, hiring students becomes a last minute task. As a result, students are often not available when we need them and when they are, further challenges may make hiring them difficult. For example, they may not have research interests within the field of digital government or they may be 1st or 2nd year students, with little experience and research independence. Further, inconsistencies with stipends (amounts and specific appointment dates) across departments for PhD students continue to be an important challenge in this respect.\n\nUniversity-wide staff challenges are also impacting the work CTG UAlbany does. In particular, the staff shortage that Sponsored Programs is experiencing poses challenges to our own research administration (pre and post award support). The lack of response and the lack of familiarity with the type of work and the type of research projects we do are only two of the negative consequences of this staff shortage. In this respect, the type of support we used to get in the past from Sponsored Programs seems to be very limited or even no longer available.\n\nIt seems that some people perceive that UAlbany research institutes, centers, and laboratories (ICLs) are making limited contributions to UAlbany. We believe this is due to a lack of indicators that allow UAlbany research institutes, centers, and laboratories (ICLs) to be assessed based on multiple dimensions. These dimensions include externally funded projects, but also publications, citations, service to the community, student engagement, and internationalization, among other important criteria. One potential way to achieve this could be to gather information from professional researchers and other staff members similar to the FAR used for faculty members. This would also help to highlight the contributions of ICLs to different university strategic priorities as well as to designations such as R1, Public Engagement Institution, etc.\n\nAlthough funding agencies encourage an interdisciplinary approach to address societal problems, most call for proposals and subsequent reviews are focused on the technical components of research topics. CTG UAlbany’s socio-technical approach to information and technology in government requires us to partner with other organizations and colleagues (who may mainly have a technical approach) which expands our networks, but it is also costly and time consuming. These partnerships are highly valued but require significant resources to build and maintain.\n</div>","resourceNeeds":"<div class=\"ExternalClass1FA313CD4CF64FBDA3E8257972D01462\">NA</div>","strategicSuggestions":"<div class=\"ExternalClass125FF1FA5D6548D1AEEE15B8AE5CC19B\">Continue to invest in support for proposal development and pre and post award support in general. Also, we think that it is very important to expand the staff and expertise of the UAlbany technology development office. Resources and expertise in this area are critical to helping CTG UAlbany and other researchers at UAlbany determine if and how their research findings can be protected and commercialized.</div>","otherthoughts":"<div class=\"ExternalClass78907030FB6E408382FBF50FF146146D\">NA</div>","partners":[{"year":"FY 22-23","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"We have a list of approximately 60 partners that we an provide in a separate document.

This year, CTG UAlbany will realize $234,166 in IFR revenue from two RF projects and $294,690 from two state-side MOUs and contracts. A budget reduction of $50,000 and a $5,100 transfer to VPRED to cover their telephone/IT expense reduced our state-side revue to $254,690.  In addition, total state overhead paid on these awards will be $17,562 and $44,204, respectively, for a total of $61,766. Finally, fringe on both accounts will be $38,969 and $36,389 respectively, for a total of $75,358. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG UAlbany FY 2022-2023 will be $336,633. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $301,812. The expense categories included technical equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG UAlbany. We do not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead we revenue generate on our own to support our OTPS budget. We also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $16,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. Our PSR state allocation of $664,650 supported 6.25 FTEs. This year we did not have the Applications Developer position as part of our PSR. The incumbent left the end of the last fiscal year and our attempt to replace them resulted in a failed search. We therefore utilized his line to move the remaining Director of Administration and Finance line over to PSR along with a portion of the CTG Director’s line. Due to the lack of IT support, we invested a much higher percentage of our IFR line to graduate and student assistants who could help fill this critical gap. The savings due to the partial movements of the two lines over to PSR helped to mitigate this cost. \nCTG UAlbany continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. \nThis year we submitted two grant proposals totaling $1,385,119 which are currently pending. The first was submitted to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for an Accountable Institutions and Behavior grant entitled, “Accountability in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” in the amount of $749,867. The second was a 3-year grant submitted to the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for a National Leadership Grant for Libraries entitled, “Empowering Communities Public Libraries, Civic Engagement and Artificial Intelligence” in the amount of $635,252.  Residual funds not utilized in this fiscal year will be used next year and in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.</div>","stateHeadcount":"6","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"6.25","rfNumber":"","proposals1":"2","proposals2":"0","proposals3":"0","awards1":"1","awards2":"0","awards3":"0","largeScale1":"0","largeScale2":"0","sttrAwards1":"0","sttrAwards2":"0","publication1":"1","publication2":"1","publication3":"15","technologyTransfer1":"1","technologyTransfer2":"0","technologyTransfer3":"0","technologyTransfer4":"0","technologyTransfer5":"0","technologyTransfer6":"0","technologyTransfer7":"0","conference":"5","educationAndTraining1":"1","educationAndTraining2":"3","educationAndTraining3":"4","educationAndTraining4":"1","goal1":"<div class=\"ExternalClass1CA19CFC8AE14C2496A9FA9601A062B3\">​​COMMERCIALIZATION AND LICENSING Increase by two the Number of commercializable CTG products and by one the # of commercialized products</div>","goal2":"<div class=\"ExternalClass221A24E04E6B43C3A931522A0DD031F1\">VISIBILITY Raise CTG’s visibility</div>","goal3":"<div class=\"ExternalClass5772A106DE654D8981B1CC3BF9DF4DAE\">TALENT Attract and retain qualified staff</div>","goal4":"<div class=\"ExternalClassC2AD95ACCB8F4470A06CE3EB6CE35FC8\">REVENUE&#58; Generate revenue</div>","goal5":"NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH POSITIONING: Strengthen the current reach and impact","actions1":"<div class=\"ExternalClass1C55218C0CD949AC8B0443824813F739\">A.\tParticipate in internal and external training opportunities.

The funding is from the Population Dynamics Branch (PDB) of NICHD. PDB is the branch that puts the RFA for the population center infrastructural grant that CSDA has acquired in the past. By having Betty Lin's R01 in this portfolio will make CSDA competitive for future center infrastructural funding. We plan to apply for funding in 2025 rather than this year (2023) so that we can acquire for 1-2 more R01s in the PDB funding portfolio.</div>","topAchievements2":"<div class=\"ExternalClass73DC42C97341469889EA598C1A4B102C\">The productivity of CSDA associates is significant. Our associates published 188 scholarly journal articles during the past academic year and 60% of those publications were in peer-reviewed journals in the first quartiles of their disciplines.\n\nCollectively, our associates applied for $17.7 million in extramural funding in 2022-2023. They won awards totalling $9.8 million. \n\nWith seed funding available in the upcoming year through ISHE, I have no doubt that CSDA associates will capitalize on that funding and develop larger-scale grants. In the past when we had seed funding through our infrastructural grant, that is exactly what happened. Moreover, our associates are much more successful in bringing in federal funding than other social science units on campus (i.e. CEMHD, CHSR).</div>","topAchievements3":"<div class=\"ExternalClass398BCD6E6D284D149A490C055AB9EDA2\">CSDA will participate in the NextGenPop program at Cornell in June, which is a program designed to support the training and mentoring of undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds into the field of demography -- see https//cpc.cornell.edu/demography-training/nextgenpop-recruiting-the-next-generation-of-population-research-scholars/\nCSDA is mentioned at the bottom.</div>","topAchievements4":"<div class=\"ExternalClass47B17DB0BCB64F3C8DCE02A41E175656\">We had three successful colloquiums this year on\n\n1) &quot;Emergency Department Closures and Mortality&quot; by Dr. Pinka Chatterji, Professor of Economics, UAlbany\n2) &quot;Places, Policies, and Population Health Drug Overdoses, COVID-19, and Long-term Mortality Trends in Rural America,&quot; By Dr. Shannon M.

We are particularly interested in continuing to develop capacity for our research associates to engage in research that links climate change and disasters to the demographics that they are currently studying and that are CSDA’s themes – health, migration, and spatial inequalities.

WIC is a program for nutrition of low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, infants, and children under the age of five by providing nutritious foods, information on healthy eating, breastfeeding promotion and support, and referrals to health care. Nationally and statewide, WIC services are underutilized, with only about half of those eligible using the program. This intensive assessment included extensive analyses of secondary data from the American Community Survey and from DOH itself to identify areas and demographics of relatively higher rates of WIC eligibility and lower WIC utilization, for use in future targeting and marketing efforts, as well as primary data collection and analysis (surveys of WIC participants and eligible non-participants, focus groups with WIC participants and eligible non-participants, and a survey of WIC local agency staff) to evaluate their understanding of WIC services and eligibility, successes in using WIC, barriers and challenges to using and maintaining WIC, and recommendations for future program implementation. </div>","topAchievements2":"<div class=\"ExternalClass71AD8B275333464085D9550FDAD69738\">CHSR created a Role Definition Matrix to better define performance expectations for each of the three main research positions within the Center.

As part of our ongoing evaluation, CHSR undertakes a series of fidelity and outcome reporting twice each year, reporting on program’s adherence to model specifications and implementation of expected activities in the past six months. These data are used to identify system-wide challenges, programs needing additional support, and programs who are not implementing the program as expected or needed. The dashboard shows performance history on each of 15 items, over 15 reporting cycles (about 7 years), for each of 45 programs. Performance is shown relative to the target performance and to the HFNY state average performance. The dashboards have been helpful to program and OCFS staff in determining whether low performance at a program or on an item is isolated to a particular cycle, is part of a history of low performance, or actually represents an improvement from previous cycles though still with room to grow. </div>","topAchievements5":"<div class=\"ExternalClass8803DCB5408F429AAD6B2B0F33F36B8B\">CHSR has published two research briefs in the past year.

Home to a 2016 NIMHD S21 Health Disparities Endowment Grant, a 2009 NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center of Excellence, and a 2004 NIMHD R24 EXPORT Center, CEMHD works toward eliminating health disparities by developing capacity in faculty at the University at Albany and partnering with community groups to identify their health concerns and the sources of disparities, and strategies to alleviate them. CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany. CEMHD's focus on minorities and under-served populations in the smaller cities and towns of Upstate New York is premised upon the notion that health disparities found in these areas differ from those in the larger cities, and that the appropriate solutions will also differ. Since most of the research on minority health disparities, and the programs that have resulted from it, has focused on populations in large cities, relatively little is known about the distinct causes of poorer health among minorities in smaller cities. Therefore, another reason for our geographical emphasis is to fill in a gap in the research.</div>","annualBudget":"Projected CEMHD ANNUAL Expenditures\nProjected expenditures from NIH funded S-21                                                         \nStipend and fringe for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $143,982.90 \nTuition and fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $91,966.09\nTravel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $12,000.00 \nTravel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Primary mentors  $12,000.00\nTravel for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Rotational mentors  $3,000.00 \nWriting support for Health Disparities Fellows  $7,890.00\nStatistical support for Health Disparities Fellows (grad student)  $6,698.64 \nSupport for advancing MHD research (grad student)  $11,164.40\nSupport for collaboration/recruitment platform development (grad student)  $24,091.60 \nLogistical support & Task Force liaison (grad student)  $25,854.40\nAssociate Director of Operations and Research   $129,535.81 \nSupport for Community Task Force   $25,000.00\nAlbany Task Force Convener   $5,000.00 \nAmsterdam Task Force Convener  $8,017.50\nDirector's stipend   $39,450.00 \nDirector Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Course releases  $20,000.00 \nEndowed Chair/Empire Innovation Professor  $25,000.00 \nPresidential Forum on Health Disparities  $12,000.00\nVenue rental with audio/visual  $2,500.00 \nCEMHD newsletter translation services  $1,200.00 \nPrinting costs for newsletter  $2,500.00\nOffice supplies  $2,000.00 \nMail/Postage  $500.00\nComputers/printers  $5,000.00 \nRapid copy  $1,000.00 \nCatering  $3,500.00\nNIH funded S-21 Total  $620,851.34\n\nProjected expenditures from Hearst Foundation\nTuition & fees (NYS rate) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows  $75,543.75\nStipend (no fringe) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows   $106,182.00 \nTravel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows   $10,000.00\nTravel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Primary mentors  $10,000.00 \nTravel for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Rotational mentors  $2,500.00\nOverhead fee (7.5%) to transfer stipend money from UAF to IFR  $7,963.65\nHearst Foundation Total  $212,189.40","stateHeadcount":"3","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"1.8","rfNumber":"","additionalAmount1":"","additionalSource1":"","additionalAmount2":"","additionalSource2":"","additionalAmount3":"","additionalSource3":"","federalApplicationsGoal":"1","privateApplicationsGoal":"1","stateApplicationsGoal":"0","federalApplicationsActual":"1","privateApplicationsActual":"0","stateApplicationsActual":"0","federalAwardsGoal":"1","privateAwardsGoal":"1","stateAwardsGoal":"0","federalAwardsActual":"0","privateAwardsActual":"1","stateAwardsActual":"0","lsProposalsGoal":"1","lsProposalsActual":"1","lsAwardsGoal":"1","lsAwardsActual":"0","sttrProposalsGoal":"0","sttrProposalsActual":"0","sttrAwardssGoal":"0","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"0","booksAuthoredActual":"0","bookChaptersGoal":"0","bookChaptersActual":"0","publicationsGoal":"40","publicationsActual":"66","listOfPublications":"<div class=\"ExternalClass725396CAA26E4539B43F0F426AC31144\">​\r\n\r\n​In Press Peer Reviewed Publications (Health Disparity Training Fellows (HDTFS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

New admissions to the Fellowship program were paused for Fall 2022 to ensure the financial stability of the program as it transitioned from combined University and Endowment revenue support to being wholly sustained by the Endowment. The full cohort currently stands at nine Fellows, including four S21-supported, and five supported by the Hearst Foundations grant. All of the S21-supported HDTFs (n=5) who began in fall of 2019, 2020, and 2021 have been retained through the current academic year, with the exception of one Fellow who elected to pause his graduate studies after receiving his master’s degree in order to return to field work in his community. In addition, the two fellows supported by Hearst Foundations that entered in 2020 have been retained, as have the three Hearst supported Fellows who entered in fall 2021. Two Fellows who began in Fall 2017 successfully defended their dissertations and had their degrees conferred, as did one Fellow who began in 2018. A second Fellow who began in 2018 defended her dissertation in January 2023 and will have her degree conferred in May 2023.\nb.\tThe Fellows’ professional accomplishments are too numerous to list here in their entirety. The Fellows have cumulatively published 95 articles in peer-reviewed journals as well as presented their research at national and international conferences. They have also participated in community minority health task forces to develop organizational and operational skills as community-engaged health disparities researchers.  Seven Fellows have graduated and now hold positions that include Director of Health Equity Research and Programs at the SUNY Upstate Medical University, Cancer Prevention Research Fellow at the National Cancer Institute, Postdoctoral Fellow in mental health equity research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, and tenure track assistant professor of criminal justice at Temple University.</div>","topAchievements2":"<div class=\"ExternalClass1F398980111E493CB6294A9D32F0929B\">Increasing the number of and diversity of health disparities scholars at UAlbany.\na.\tThe search for a preeminent scholar to lead the University’s efforts in health disparities has successfully concluded.

The keynote speech was delivered by Dr. Eliseo J. Perez-Stabe, “Community Engaged Research Pathway to Reducing Disparities.” Dr. Perez-Stable is the Director of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. There were 127 attendees, including Community partners, government officials, researchers, faculty, professional staff, postdoctoral associates, and students. A panel discussion followed the keynote, including faculty engaged in community-based research and their partners from community organizations.\nb. In February and March, the CEMHD presented two noted authorities on health equity research as the latest events in its contributions to the Race and Health speaker series co-sponsored by CEMHD, the Office of the President, and the Division for Research and Economic Development. These two talks were also supported by University Auxiliary Services and open to the public. Dr. Jennifer D. Roberts and Dr. Dána-Ain Davis gave powerful presentations enthusiastically received by audiences of over 100 people including members of the University community as well as participants from New York State’s Capital Region and beyond. Dr. Roberts’ talk entitled “I Can’t Breathe” Environmental Racism in the United States” explored the historical and contemporary inequities that stem from structural racism within the United States through an examination of built, social and natural environments. Dr. Jennifer D. Roberts is an Associate Professor in the Department of Kinesiology, School of Public Health at the University of Maryland College Park (UMD). Dr. Roberts is also the Founder and Director of the Public Health Outcomes and Effects of the Built Environment (PHOEBE) Laboratory as well as the Co-Founder and Co-Director of NatureRx@UMD, an initiative that emphasizes the green space benefits interspersed throughout and around the UMD campus and acknowledges the ancestral lands of the Piscataway People as well as the historical slave trade legacies of the UMD campus land. Dr. Dána-Ain Davis is Professor of Urban Studies and Anthropology at Queens College, City University of New York (CUNY) and on the faculty of the PhD Program in Critical Psychology. She is the director of the Center for the Study of Women and Society at the CUNY Graduate Center. Her talk, titled “Traumatic Repercussions Black Women and Obstetric Racism” discussed how race confounds the perception that class is the root of adverse birth outcomes and the role that birth workers—midwives, doulas, and birth advocates - play in addressing Black women’s birth outcomes.</div>","topAchievements4":"<div class=\"ExternalClassB39DDB081360487595C5A0DEA4061A88\">S-21 Renewal submission January 17th, 2023. CEMHD led the development and submission of the renewal application to the NIMHD for an additional $10,000,000 endowment to to build research and training capacity in minority health and health disparities and contribute to the diversification of the scientific workforce. Specifically, we will use the Renewal Endowment to diversify and increase the number of faculty scholars engaging in health disparities research at UAlbany while also expanding opportunities for career development and training in research strategies identified as priorities by the NIMHD. These activities will complement the activities being accomplished with the support of our 2016 Endowment, through which we are increasing the number of PhD-trained scientists and professionals from underrepresented groups with the Presidential Health Disparities Doctoral Fellowship Program.

Regular members include community leaders affiliated with governmental and other organizations dedicated to health and human services and UAlbany researchers. Members work together to identify causes and possible solutions for health disparities, develop research projects, and provide guidance on research projects in these communities. Each task force convenes approximately once a month. The Albany Minority Health Task Force focuses primarily on the needs of the Black/African American community and low-income families in Albany. The Amsterdam Minority Health Task Force focuses on the needs of immigrants, individuals with limited English proficiency (particularly Spanish speakers), mothers, and the elderly in the more rural regions of Montgomery and Fulton counties of New York. HDTFs participate in the community health task forces to develop the Fellows’ organizational and operational skills and qualifications as community engaged health disparities researchers thus aiding in the acquisition of a professional position.

Together, the Hearst award and the S-21 endowment are projected to support, as of Fall 2023, a transdisciplinary doctoral fellowship program for 12 doctoral students from programs across the University. Center staff are working to address administrative challenges accompanying this expansion while continuing to innovate to support the Fellows in their home departments, while ensuring that they receive the transdisciplinary training that is a signature strength of the fellowship program. As the endowment grows, and the Center is able to grow its research-related activities (e.g., pursuit of external research funding, speaker series, workshops for faculty to promote community enaged research, supporting pilot research projects), additional staff will be needed.</div>","resourceNeeds":"<div class=\"ExternalClassCF0E7B2FCBAD4669ACAFD05B3FC70CEE\">Additional staff support.</div>","strategicSuggestions":"<div class=\"ExternalClass9CB50DDCCAD34F19A93DF7438C0D67A2\">Funding of pilot projects that are specifically tied to the pursuit of external funding opportunities is an important strategy.

CEMHD’s activities focus on three major interrelated areas, in the service of contributing to the elimination of minority health disparities community engagement, fostering health disparities research, and supporting the development of new health disparities scholars.</div>","vision":"<div class=\"ExternalClass24963DACDFDA4AF1823F7B29CD940EF3\">​​​​The Center for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities (CEMHD), is a collaborative effort focusing on minority health disparities in the smaller cities and towns of New York. Home to a 2016 NIMHD S21 Health Disparities Endowment Grant, a 2009 NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center of Excellence, and a 2004 NIMHD R24 EXPORT Center, CEMHD works toward eliminating health disparities by developing capacity in faculty at the University at Albany and partnering with community groups to identify their health concerns and the sources of disparities, and strategies to alleviate them. CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany. CEMHD's focus on minorities and under-served populations in the smaller cities and towns of Upstate New York is premised upon the notion that health disparities found in these areas differ from those in the larger cities, and that the appropriate solutions will also differ. Since most of the research on minority health disparities, and the programs that have resulted from it, has focused on populations in large cities, relatively little is known about the distinct causes of poorer health among minorities in smaller cities. Therefore, another reason for our geographical emphasis is to fill in a gap in the research.</div>","annualBudget":"<div class=\"ExternalClass402A659E963E4BCBA1CAEF44924460EB\">​CEMHD ANNUAL Expenditures\n\nProjected Expenditures for Next Budget Period (7/1/2023 - 6/30/2024) \t\n\nCEMHD RF expenses\t\nHealth Disparities Fellows (HDFs) Stipends &amp; Fringe\t$150,927.09\nHealth Disparities Fellows (HDFs) Tuition and Mandatory Fees\t$84,573.30\nTravel for HD Fellows and Primary Mentors \t$18,000.00\nMembership dues for HD Fellows and Primary mentors\t$6,000.00\nTravel for Rotational Mentors\t$3,000.00\nGrad student support for advancing MHD research (AW &amp; CW)\t$47,242.00\nTask Force Support\t$35,000.00\nPresident's Forum on Health Disparities\t$10,000.00\nSpeaker Series\t$5,000.00\nDirector's stipend &amp; fringe (academic year)\t$28,400.00\nDirector's stipend &amp; fringe (summer)\t$11,450.00\nDirector Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 Course releases (at cost)\t$18,000.00\nAssoc.

Over the past five years, ASRC’s payroll expenditures totaled $10,706,372 – an average of $2,141,274 per year. One full-time research facilitator and one part-time IT support person are supported by the VPR. Post-docs, research scientists, visiting scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students are primarily paid from research grants; some are supported from start-up funds provided to SUNY2020 faculty. Most ASRC faculty are on 9-month academic year appointments and are paid summer salary from research grants or start-up funds. OTPS&#58; ASRC’s operations, including operations at the UAlbany location and at Whiteface Mountain, are covered by IFR revenue recovered from sponsored programs. Over the past five years, ASRC’s OTPS expenditures at the Albany location have totaled $202,696, an average of $40,539 per year. Not counting annual telephone charges of almost $19,000 per year, OTPS expenses at ASRC average about $21,539 per year. The Whiteface location’s OTPS expenditures over five years total $77,606, an average of $15,521 per year. One faculty member had a legacy IFR account that covered some OTPS expenses such as Verizon Wireless. Strategic Investment&#58; In the past, ASRC has received overhead recovery from the VPR to be used to grow research activity at ASRC. We have about $70,900 remaining in cash to spend on the state-side. On the RF side there is a legacy overhead recovery account primarily used in support of our RF p-card program as the initial source to pay the Bank of America bill monthly; expenses are then moved to the appropriate sponsored award through a reconciliation process. Events&#58; ASRC has both UAlbany Foundation funds in the Ray Falconer Endowment and UAS (Auxiliary Services) funds to support lectures and colloquies.</span></span><br></div></div>","stateHeadcount":"22","rfHeadcount":"68","stateNumber":"20.68","rfNumber":"51.65","proposals1":"24.2","proposals2":"","proposals3":"","awards1":"","awards2":"","awards3":"","largeScale1":"","largeScale2":"","sttrAwards1":"","sttrAwards2":"","publication1":"","publication2":"","publication3":"","technologyTransfer1":"","technologyTransfer2":"","technologyTransfer3":"","technologyTransfer4":"","technologyTransfer5":"","technologyTransfer6":"","technologyTransfer7":"","conference":"","educationAndTraining1":"","educationAndTraining2":"","educationAndTraining3":"","educationAndTraining4":"","goal1":"<div class=\"ExternalClass07D4BFD9CC4E4EAFA364D5CE5D8FAC67\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​</span>Maintain strengths and establish new research strengths (in wake of upcoming retirements)&#58;<br></div><div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\">• Renewable Energy/Grid Resiliency<br>• Atmospheric Chemistry (including Whiteface activity)<br>• Climate<br>• Urban Environment and Health<br>• AI applications in Atmospheric Sciences<br>• Hydrology (including water resources, flooding applications</div></span><br></div></div>","goal2":"","goal3":"","goal4":"","goal5":"","actions1":"<div class=\"ExternalClassB25E474CFCC94B3EAE493E82A2B746BE\"><div style=\"font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​<div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"color&#58;black;\">​</span>Through interdisciplinary collaborations pursue funding from all applicable federal, state, and private sources within these research strengths.<br></div><div style=\"color&#58;rgb(50, 49, 48);font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br>Seek hires in faculty, students and staff to contribute to these themes.</div></span><br></div></div>","actions2":"","actions3":"","actions4":"","actions5":"","metrics1":"Metrics include:   (i) New Grants, (ii) Published papers and white papers, (iii) successful recruitment","metrics2":"","metrics3":"","metrics4":"","metrics5":"","timeframe1":"May 2023","timeframe2":"","timeframe3":"","timeframe4":"","timeframe5":"","primaryLeader1":"Chris Thorncroft in collaboration with Research Theme Leaders","primaryLeader2":"","primaryLeader3":"","primaryLeader4":"","primaryLeader5":"","impactWorkplan1":"","impactWorkplan2":"","impactWorkplan3":"","impactWorkplan4":"","impactWorkplan5":"","collaboratingUnits1":"","collaboratingUnits2":"","collaboratingUnits3":"","collaboratingUnits4":"","collaboratingUnits5":"","impactResearchExcellence1":"","impactResearchExcellence2":"","impactResearchExcellence3":"","impactResearchExcellence4":"","impactResearchExcellence5":""}}],"FY":"FY 22-23"}
